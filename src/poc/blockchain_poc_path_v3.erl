%%% @doc blockchain_poc_path_v3 implementation.
%%%
%%% The way paths are built depends solely on witnessing data we have accumulated
%%% in the blockchain ledger.
%%%
%%% Consider X having [A, B, C, D] as its geographic neighbors but only
%%% having [A, C, E] as it's transmission witnesses. It stands to reason
%%% that we would expect packets from X -> any[A, C, E] to work with relatively
%%% high confidence compared to its geographic neighbors. RF varies
%%% heavily depending on surroundings therefore relying only on geographic
%%% vicinity is not enough to build potentially interesting paths.
%%%
%%% In order to build a path, we first find a target gateway using
%%% blockchain_poc_target_v3:target/3 and build a path outward from it.
%%%
%%% Once we have a target we recursively find a potential next hop from the target
%%% gateway by looking into its witness list.
%%%
%%% Before we calculate the probability associated with each witness in witness
%%% list, we filter out potentially useless paths, depending on the following filters:
%%% - Next hop witness must not be in the same hex index as the target
%%% - Every hop in the path must be unique
%%% - Every hop in the path must have a minimum exclusion distance
%%% - Next Hop witness must have the required capability
%%%
%%% The criteria for a potential next hop witness are biased like so:
%%% - P(WitnessRSSI)  = Probability that the witness has a good (valid) RSSI.
%%% - P(WitnessTime)  = Probability that the witness timestamp is not stale.
%%% - P(WitnessCount) = Probability that the witness is infrequent.
%%%
%%% The overall probability of picking a next witness is additive depending on
%%% chain var configurable weights for each one of the calculated probs.
%%% P(Witness) = RSSIWeight*P(WitnessRSSI) + TimeWeight*P(WitnessTime) + CountWeight*P(WitnessCount)
%%%
%%% We scale these probabilities and run an ICDF to select the witness from
%%% the witness list. Once we have a potential next hop, we simply do the same process
%%% for the next hop and continue building till the path limit is reached or there
%%% are no more witnesses to continue with.
