Transfer semantics meeting agenda:

We need to work out the precise semantics of restaking and transfer during cooldown (and a few other cases).

- Transfer questions:
  - NO: Can transfer during cooldown (current feeling, no, just cancel and transfer)
  - YES: Can transfer to another owner (currently it's just moving the stake from validator to validator in the same account)?
  - NO: Can transfer stake partially (i.e. I overstake 20k and want to transfer 10k to another validator)? (limit to exact stake)
- Restaking:
  - YES: Do we want to allow cooldown cancel?
  - If so how (current feeling: another stake transaction for the same owner/validator cancels cooldown)?
- Understake:
  - NO: Do we allow this?  It might be good for people who want be a proxy?
  - If so what is the minimum stake for proxying?  move to v2? <- YES
- Elections:
  - do we allow people to be in the group while they're in unstaking cooldown?
